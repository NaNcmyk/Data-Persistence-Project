# CHALLENGE: Implement Data Persistence
[Mission #3](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/submission-data-persistence-in-a-new-repo) of Unity Learn's Junior Programmer Pathway.

## Key Features
1. Saving data between scenes: a piece of data set in one scene will be stored and used in another scene.
1. Saving data between sessions: a piece of data set during runtime will be saved and used the next time the application is run. 

## Instructions
### Player name (saving data between scenes)
- [ ] Create a new Start Menu scene for the game with a text entry field prompting the user to enter their name, and a Start button.
- [ ] When the user clicks the Start button, the Main game scene will be loaded and their name will be displayed next to the score. 
### High score (saving data between sessions):
- [ ] As the user plays, the current high score will be displayed on the screen alongside the player name who created the score.
- [ ] If the high score is beaten, the new score and player name will be displayed instead.
- [ ] The highest score will be saved between sessions, so that if the player closes and reopens the application, the high score and player name will be retained.
